# Note
This repository contains our experimental data, including measured suction force for different duct shapes and different rotational speeds. Videos of the initial hover experiments are also available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UAqlNLSlt1IvAICOtqUeHkihsGONR1j0?usp=sharing

# Theory and Experimental Setup

We executed a tabletop experiment to record the suction force with the force sensor.

These are the airflow visualisation experiments, showing the difference in velocity of airflow due to different duct shapes.
